Interactive Design - Assignment 2 (Ee Jun Kai Julian) (21/12/2020)

# Introduction
This website or mobile application is made to allow users to look through the official Pokedex. They will be able to see more about the ID of the Pokémon, the name of the Pokémon as well as the Type(s) of the Pokémon. 

I decided to come up with this Pokémon Information Center website/application because I am a Pokémon fan myself. I really enjoy the gameplay and art of Pokémon ever since I was younger. Overall, I wish to educate more people about the various Pokémon that exist and hopefully spread the fun and joy the game offers.

## Design Process

* **Newcomers**
    * The newcomers will be able to look at the various types of Pokémon in the Pokedex of different generations and hopefully slowly gain interest towards the game.

* **Fans**
    * The fans will be able to look for their favourite Pokémons and understand more about specific types. This will allow them to improve their understanding of other Pokémons which they can utilize in-game.
    * The fans will also be able to look at the various Pokémon Type advantages and disadvantages. This will allow them to gain extra knowledge on the game which they can use to their advantage in Player-versus-Player combat.
